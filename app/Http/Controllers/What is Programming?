What is Programming? 

Hello everyone! So I have decided to go down the introduction to programming route at first.
But, before we jump in to writing any code or learning how to code let's first answer what 
programming really is.

So what is programming? What is a computer program? Essentially, a program is a series of steps 
that guides the computer to do the tasks that you want it to specifically do. Without programmers, 
computers are actually really stupid. Obiedient might be the better word. Furthermore, a computer 
basically listens to every command that you give it. The computer is essentially a tool! 

In programming, you are able to find solutions to problems. The vast opprotunities are endless.
